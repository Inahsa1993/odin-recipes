    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons plus 1 pinch salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>12 ounces dried ziti</li>
        <li>2 cups mixed fresh vegetables, such as asparagus, matchstick carrots and sliced onions</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chicken soup base, such as Better than BouillonÂ®</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black peppe</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1 packed cup chopped fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>fresh basil sprigs for garnish</li>

    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Gather all ingredients. </li>
    <li>Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add panko and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, 
        until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the Dutch oven and set aside. Wipe out the pot with paper towels.</li>
    <li>To the same pot, over medium-high heat, add 3 1/2 cups water, and stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Add 12 ounces ziti and stir to combine. 
        Boil uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 6 minutes. </li>
    <li>Stir in vegetables, garlic, herb seasoning, soup base, and pepper; return to a boil.
        Cook until pasta and vegetables are barely tender, and the water is nearly gone, about 4 minutes. </li>
    <li> Stir in chicken and spinach, and cook about 1 minute longer. Remove from heat. Stir in sour cream and Parmesan cheese. </li>
    <li> Place mixture into a serving bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Top with reserved panko, garnish with fresh basil, and serve warm. </li>
